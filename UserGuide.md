Welcome to the User Guide for the Sustainability Application. This guide will help you understand how to use the application effectively.


## Introduction

Thank you for choosing our smart energy-saving solution. With this system, users take the lead in managing energy use more efficiently and sustainably. By installing the compact hardware in the home, office, mall, or godowns, users unlock the power of real-time monitoring and intelligent insights—all through a simple mobile app. As soon as users connect to the device, the app begins tracking energy consumption. From there, it guides with personalized suggestions, helping users make smart choices that reduce bills and environmental impact. Whether users are at home or on the go, they stay in control because saving energy is easy, effective, and empowering.
